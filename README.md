## Things to know

We use Bulma as the css framework.

There are 6 slides + 1 long page. The order is all horizontal pages go first and then we have the long page as the final one.

From now on:

Slide 1 – Presentation component - nicknamed FirstSlide in `./src/components/Ico/FirstSlide`
Slide 2 – Graph component - nicknamed SecondSlide in `./src/components/Ico/SecondSlide`
Slide 3 – Docs component - nicknamed ThirdSlide in `./src/components/Ico/ThirdSlide`
Slide 4 – - nicknamed FirstSlide in `./src/components/Ico/FirstSlide`
Slide 5 –
Slide 6 – Archives component
Slide 7 – Fullpage component

We will be prioritizing speed over optimization and order in this project. The more that gets done the better, we can deal with messiness. If you can make something reusable, do it but if it will take you twice the amount of time that just coding it again, just copy it again.

There is a need to change the background. So every time you come in a different background will get assigned to you at random. There is an initial coding of that feature but it’s not working as of now. Will supply the different backgrounds myself and you can see the ones we have already in `./public/js/backgrounds/`

## Priority order:

1. Carousel (this is expected to be done in max. 1 full day of work)
2. Finishing Slide 1-4
3.
4. Main component should be fullscreen with exact size of the screen no matter the resolution. On scroll, the footer should uncover.
